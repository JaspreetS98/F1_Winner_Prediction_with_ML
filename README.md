F1 Winner Prediction with machine learning

This study consists mainly of the machine learning subject in order to apply principles of data collection, cleaning, analysis, and subsequently creation of machine learning models and their testing and evaluation. The presented work’s aim is not focused on presenting a new approach but rather searching for ways to improve the prediction model. The models will mostly be tested on a limited range of recent seasons for specific and more relevant accuracy to the present, despite the fact that they can be tested on any given season with the caveat that more data is missing as the season tested gets older.In the same regard, very recent seasons won’t be tested as recent regulation changes took place and now the 2022 regulations represent the biggest overhaul in the sport for years.
